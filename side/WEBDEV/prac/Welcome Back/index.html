			<h2>Don't Forget, you're here forever</h2>
		
			<p> We don't want you going anywhere now, do we?</p>

			<p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.</p>

			<p>Put it in, leave it alone. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. You need the dark in order to show the light. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.</p>

			<p>Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Don't be bashful drop me a line. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens.</p>

			<p>Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there.</p>

			<p>That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.</p>

			<p>It's important to me that you're happy. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. A happy cloud.</p>

			<p>That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Let's get wild today. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.</p>

			<p>Just beat the devil out of it. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Brown is such a nice color. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. We don't have anything but happy trees here.</p>

			<p>No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Imagination is the key to painting.</p>

			<p>I'm a water fanatic. I love water. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.</p>
